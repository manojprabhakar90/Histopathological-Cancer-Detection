# Histopathological-Cancer-Detection

This is part of the Deep learning course at University of Colorado Boulder. The current notebook uses Keras as Backend and EfficientNetB0 network for detecting Histopathological Cancer. 

Introduction
Cancer is one of the most prevalent diseases causing around 10 million deaths worldwide. Source(https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer). With the advancements in Deep learning, we can leverage it to detect cancer images from the non cancer ones. The main objective of this competition is to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from pathology scans.
